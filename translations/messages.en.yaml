      company: Verb Interactive
      description: >-
        My time at Verb interactive had a majority of my time and focus on a
        single project from the initial requirements gathering to final release
        for a Canadian Ferries Company. My project consisted of creating a
        booking engine for passengers to fully create and/or amend their
        bookings online. The primary data API is accessed through a 3rd party
        SOAP API. Using Symfony5, we created middleware to simplify the SOAP API
        and offer a much simpler, internal REST API for the booking front-end.
        The front-end for this system utilizes the latest version of React using
        Redux, written in Typescript. Payments for the system are handled
        through the Moneris API and Moneris Hosted Payments. The project was
        managed through agile sprints. Git was used using feature branches,
        proper merge requests and code review. Multiple continuous integration
        pipelines were set up and maintained to build and deploy to their
        respective environment servers.
